- Real-time position interpolation during movement
- Smooth curved paths using arc motion calculations
- Continuous trail drawing during movement
- Configurable animation FPS in config file

### 2. Enhanced Angle Controls
- **Exact Angle Entry**: Text box for setting precise angles
- **Quick Rotation Buttons**:
  - 180° CCW / 180° CW
  - 90° CCW / 90° CW  
  - 15° CCW / 15° CW
  - Reset to 0° angle
- All rotations use shortest path calculation

### 3. Configuration File System
- Hardware parameters moved to `robot_config.ini`
- No more manual config entry in GUI
- Easy to modify robot specifications
- Separate simulation settings

### 4. Improved Mouse Interaction
- **Left Click**: Shows coordinates in GUI (no console output)
- **Right Click**: "Go To" command - robot moves to clicked location
- **Mouse Hover**: Real-time coordinate display
- Automatic path planning for right-click movements

### 5. Redesigned GUI Layout
- Removed wheel diameter/wheelbase controls from GUI
- Added dedicated Angle Control panel
- Click coordinates displayed in Display Settings
- Cleaner, more organized layout

## Usage Examples

### Quick Movement
1. **Forward/Back**: Set distance, click Forward/Back buttons
2. **Rotation**: Use angle buttons or set exact angle
3. **Go To Location**: Right-click anywhere in workspace

### Drawing
1. Click "Pen Down"
2. Right-click to draw straight lines to locations
3. Use demo patterns for complex shapes

### Configuration
Edit `robot_config.ini` to match your hardware:
```ini
[robot_hardware]
wheel_diameter_mm = 25.0
wheelbase_mm = 30.0
steps_per_revolution = 2048

[simulation]
animation_fps = 12
```

## Running the Enhanced Simulator

```bash
cd robot_simulator
python standalone_tracker.py
```

The simulator now provides smooth, real-time animation that accurately represents the speed and motion of your physical robot!
