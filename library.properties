sentence=Arduino library for controlling differential drive wheeled robots with stepper motors and servo pen control.
paragraph=Provides complete robot control with step-based movement coordination (Phase 1.5), hardware abstraction for 28BYJ stepper motors via ULN2803A driver, servo control for pen up/down mechanism, and differential drive kinematics foundation. Designed for drawing robots and similar applications requiring precise 2D movement control.
